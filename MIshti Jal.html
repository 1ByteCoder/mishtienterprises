<p3>Mishti Jal is an exclusive production company popularly known for packaged drinking water. We ensure to deliver quality product at reasonable/customer friendly price. In a country where sufficient and safe potable water is not available everywhere, either because
harmful chemical substances are found in the layers of earth which enter into water or because the water may be contaminated due to pathogenic microorganisms. Water filteration process of Mishti Jal is subjected to treatment like
decantation, filtration (including aeration filtration with membrane filter, cartridge filter, activated carbon filtration), demineralisation, mineralisation and reverse osmosis. The packaged water is also disinfected
